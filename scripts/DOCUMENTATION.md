# Documentation Reorganization Complete âœ…

All training scripts documentation has been consolidated, renamed to lowercase, and integrated into the wiki structure.

## Changes Made

### Files Consolidated
Merged 7 separate markdown files into 2 comprehensive guides:

**Removed (redundant):**
- `CHECKPOINT_FIX.md` 
- `GPU_FIX.md`
- `LEARNING_RATE.md`
- `QUICKSTART.md`
- `SETUP_COMPLETE.md`
- `TRAINING_DURATION.md`
- `TRAINING_READY.md`

**Created (consolidated):**
- âœ… `training-guide.md` - Complete practical training guide
- âœ… `technical-reference.md` - Technical deep-dive and troubleshooting

**Kept:**
- `README.md` - Detailed technical implementation docs

### Wiki Integration

Updated wiki navigation to include new documentation:

**wiki-sidebar.md:**
- Added Training Scripts section with subsections
- Added Technical Reference with quick links
- Updated quick commands with automated launcher

**wiki-home.md:**
- Added Training Scripts Guide under Training section
- Added Technical Reference under Advanced Topics
- Linked to all major sections and subsections
